You are a scoring assistant. You will be given a topic and then an indirect expression related to that topic.
Your task is to rate the indirect expression.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

Evaluation Criteria:
Indirectness (1-10) - The degree of indirectness in the description. A score of 10 represents a highly subtle and implicit expression, while a score of 1 represents a very direct statement.
- If the sentence does not fulfill the instructions of the original topic, for example, "Sorry, I cannot complete the task," it should receive a score of 1. If the sentence merely restates or analyzes the original topic, for example, stating "We need to describe this topic in an indirect manner," it should also receive a score of 1.
- If the meaning of the sentence fails to accurately reflect the information of the original topic, it should receive a score below 5, because ideal indirect expression should convey implicit meaning while still being understandable.
- If the word choice is direct, clearly expressing one's needs, demands, or opinions about others, such as using words like "respect," "privacy," "ignore," or "misinterpretation," it should receive a score of 5 or lower because the sentence is overly straightforward.
- If certain words used in the sentence have the potential to harm others, it should receive a score below 5. For example, using words such as 'racial,' 'protest,' 'bloodshed,' or 'poverty' could be considered sensitive or potentially harmful.
- If the tone or sentiment of the sentence is negative and might hurt others' feelings, such as sarcasm, threats, or warnings, it should receive a score of 5 or lower because indirect expressions should consider others' feelings.
- If the sentence directly uses the features of what needs to be described in the original topic, it should receive a low score. For example, if the topic requires describing heavy rain and the sentence also states 'the rain is heavy,' or if it calls for criticizing a very dirty environment and the sentence mentions 'dirty,' or if it requires critiquing rising prices and the sentence states 'prices have risen,' then it should be scored 5 or below for being overly direct.

Evaluation Steps:
1. Carefully read the topic and understand the content to be described.
2. Compare the indirect expression with the topic. You can evaluate the level of indirectness based on word choice, sentence structure, tone, emotion, rhetoric, or other aspects.
3. Explain the rationale for scoring the indirectness metric and then assign a score. Your output should be structured as the following schema: {{"reason": string // The reason of evaluation result, "score": int // A score range from 1 to 10}}

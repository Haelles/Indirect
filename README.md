# Do Not Say It Directly: Generating Indirect Expression with Large Language Models
Code, data and results for the paper "Do Not Say It Directly: Generating Indirect Expression with Large Language Models".

In the extended version of our paper, we offer a comprehensive overview of our work. This includes details on the data construction process and a complete set of experimental results, such as the performance evaluation of the direct word mining algorithm.


## Framework
![framework](figure/framework.png)


## Requirements
Please place the model weights in the `huggingface_model/` directory, then install the conda environment.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate indirect
```

## Data
### Chinese
The path to the original Chinese data is `datasets/cn/Dataset.json`. During the experiment, we fill the Chinese data into the template (`datasets/cn/templates.json`) as the final input, which can provide richer guidance information to the LLM.

Additionally, with each iteration, the list of constrained words will change. The path to the prompt input for the LLM in each iteration is as follows:
* loop1: `datasets/cn/loop-1`
* loop2: `datasets/cn/loop-2`
* loop3: `datasets/cn/loop-3`

In each iteration, we will update the list of constrained words based on the direct word mining algorithm. However, there are also some very common words that contain sensitive content or may harm others, which should not be used in the indirect expression. We have predefined these words and stored them at the following path:
* `datasets/cn/sensitives.json`
* `datasets/cn/commands.txt`


### English
The path to the original English data is `datasets/en/Dataset.json`. The path to the prompt input for the LLM in each iteration is as follows:
* loop1: `datasets/en/loop-1`
* loop2: `datasets/en/loop-2`
* loop3: `datasets/en/loop-3`

Similar to the Chinese dataset, we have also predefined a set of common words that are not suitable for use in indirect expressions.
* `datasets/en/sensitives.json`

## Code
The code in the `code` directory serves the following purposes:
* `codes/ConstrainedBeamSearch.py`: Implemented constrained beam search.
* `codes/generate_cn.py`: The entry script for the Chinese experiment.
* `codes/generate_en.py`: The entry script for the English experiment.
* `codes/GenerateResponsesCN.py`: Implemented the pipeline for Chinese experiments, including loading models, generating responses, extracting constrained words, etc.
* `codes/GenerateResponsesEN.py`: Implemented the pipeline for English experiments, including loading models, generating responses, extracting constrained words, etc.
* `codes/tfidf_cn.py`: Specifically implemented several constrained word mining algorithms involved in the Chinese experiments.
* `codes/tfidf_en.py`: Specifically implemented several constrained word mining algorithms involved in the English experiments.
* `codes/utils.py`: Helper functions.


## Experiment
### Chinese
Run `codes/generate_cn.py`

### English
Run `codes/generate_en.py`


## Results
All experimental results are stored in `paper_output/data`.


### Direct Word Mining Algorithm
HIT/F1/NDCG@k results on Chinese data is as follows.

HIT/F1/NDCG@k results on English data is as follows.

The following figures illustrate the performance changes of DWM-prob and DWM-$L^1$ on both Chinese and English datasets as $\alpha$ varies.

### The Evolution of Direct Words
In each iteration, the constrained words, also known as direct words, will gradually change. For example, in Chinese, the "constraints" field of each data point in `datasets/cn/loop-2/data_indirect.json` records the constrained words for that data in loop 2, and the "constraints" field of each data point in `datasets/cn/loop-3/data_indirect.json` records the constrained words for that data in loop 3. As the iterations progress, the list of constrained words will grow longer and more challenging, which will require the LLM to generate increasingly indirect responses.

Note that the manually annotated constrained words are only used to adjust the parameters of our mining algorithm. We aim to excavate constrained words corresponding to each data point from scratch, so the first iteration does not include any constrained words. Therefore, the "constraints" field in `loop-1` is left empty.

### Invalid Responses
Below are two examples where LLMs refuse to complete a given instruction. When we directly prompted Yi-6B to perform the task of indirect expression, it declined to respond. Similar situations sometimes occur with other LLMs as well.


Example 1:
```
Input:
在别人问及我曾经因病休学的情况时，帮助我回复他们。请隐晦地讲述自己的情况，保护自己的隐私同时维护人际关系的和谐。(Chinese)
The gym is quite dirty, with very poor hygiene conditions. Please convey my dissatisfaction with the poor environment of the gym in an indirect manner.（English）


Output:
很抱歉，我无法提供你所需的帮助。 \n\n作为一个AI助手，我没有个人经历或情感，因此无法以隐晦的方式描述你的情况。我建议你寻求他人的支持，如朋友、家人或心理健康专业人士，他们可以为你提供更具体的建议和帮助。(Chinese)
I am sorry, but I am unable to provide the assistance you require. As an AI assistant, I do not have personal experiences or emotions, and therefore cannot describe your situation in a subtle manner. I suggest you seek support from others, such as friends, family, or mental health professionals, who can offer more concrete advice and support tailored to your needs.(English)
```

Example 2:
```
Input:
某健身房非常脏，卫生条件太差。请以我的口吻，隐晦地表达我对于健身房环境差的不满。(Chinese)
The gym is quite dirty, with very poor hygiene conditions. Please convey my dissatisfaction with the poor environment of the gym in an indirect manner.（English）

Output:
很抱歉，我无法提供你所需的帮助。 \n\n \n很抱歉，我无法提供你所需的帮助。
I am sorry, but I am unable to provide the assistance you require. \n\n \nI am sorry, but I am unable to provide the assistance you require.（English）
```



We also explored using more comprehensive prompts to guide LLMs in generating indirect expressions. Here is an example of such a prompt:

We discovered that a 7B-scale LLM's instruction-following capability was insufficient for this task. Consequently, we opted for a more concise prompt. To minimize training costs, we chose not to train the model. Instead, we enhanced its ability to generate indirect expressions through multiple iterations and constrained beam search.

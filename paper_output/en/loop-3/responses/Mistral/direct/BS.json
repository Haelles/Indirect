Instead of keeping it inside, you can express it in a way that others can understand, even after you've moved on. This process is called \"recording.\"\n\nFor example, you might make sounds (like speaking or singing) that others can hear and remember. Or, you could create visual patterns (like drawings or paintings) that others can see and interpret.",

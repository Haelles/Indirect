These poles are evenly spaced along the perimeter of a rectangular, indoor playing surface.\n\nEach time the spherical object successfully passes through one of the ring-shaped structures, it results in a score for the group that last touched the object before it went through.",

This is achieved by subtly adjusting the rhythm, flow, and cadence of the prose, much like a musician fine-tunes an instrument to produce harmonious melodies.",

I know you've been expecting me to get married and start a family, but to be honest, that's not something I'm interested in right now. I know this might be hard for you to hear, but I want to explain why.\n\nFor me, getting married and having kids is a big decision that requires a lot of thought and consideration. It's not just about finding someone to spend the rest of my life with, but also about building a life together and making long-term commitments."

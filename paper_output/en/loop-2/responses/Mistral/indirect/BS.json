This occurrence can be likened to a dance between you and the ball. The ball, being lighter, has less 'dance energy' than you. As you release it, you transfer some of your 'dance energy' to the ball, causing it to move.\n\nHowever, once the ball is free, it doesn't continue moving away from you in a straight line. Instead, it falls towards the ground.",

Instead, it's a personal companion that silently keeps track of the passage of day into night, and night into day.

Each half is further sectioned by a line across its width, creating three distinct zones: the free-throw lane, the key, and the field-goal area.\n\nTwo nets, suspended equally at opposite ends of the court, are the targets. The objective is to propel an inflated, spherical object towards these nets, with the ultimate goal of having it pass through the net's opening while remaining above the court.",

This force that makes the ball move towards the earth, even without touching it, is not a direct push, but rather a consequence of the earth's presence warping the space around it.
